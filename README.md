### 0x01 Introduction 

Team project to build a clone of AirBnB. 

The console is a command interpreter to manage objects abstraction between objects and how they are stored. 

The console should be able to perform the following tasks: 

 - create a new object
 - retrieve an object from a file 
 - carry out operations on the object
 - destroy an object.

 **Storage**

 All the classes are handled by the `Storage` engine in the `FileStorage class.
